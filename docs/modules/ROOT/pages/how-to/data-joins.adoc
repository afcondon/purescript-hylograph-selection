[NOTE]
====
This guide is coming soon. It will cover:

* The General Update Pattern (GUP)
* `joinData` vs `updateJoin` vs `nestedJoin`
* Key functions for identity matching
* Enter/update/exit transitions
* Nested data structures
====

== Quick Reference

[source,purescript]
----
-- Simple join (no transitions)
A.joinData "circles" "circle" myData $ \d ->
  A.elem Circle [ cx (from _.x), cy (from _.y) ]

-- With enter/update/exit
A.updateJoin "circles" "circle" myData
  (\d -> A.elem Circle [ cx (from _.x), cy (from _.y) ])
  { enter: Just { attrs: [ opacity (num 0.0) ], transition: Just fadeIn }
  , update: Just { attrs: [], transition: Just move }
  , exit: Just { attrs: [], transition: Just fadeOut }
  , keyFn: Just _.id
  }
