== Pedagogic Recursion Schemes

The comonadic spreadsheet abstraction makes recursion schemes approachable:

* Fold trees that visualize how SUM actually computes
* Histomorphisms for moving averages (each step sees its history)
* The "Context View" showing what a cell can see (neighbors, position)
* `extend` as the theory behind "fill down"

This has real teaching potential - spreadsheets as a gateway to FP concepts.

== Spreadsheets as Build Systems

Reference: "Build Systems à la Carte" by Mokhov, Mitchell, Peyton Jones (2018)

Key insight: Excel and Make are both build systems with different rebuild strategies:

* Excel: minimal rebuild based on dependency graph
* Make: topological ordering with timestamps

Our functional spreadsheet could model:

* *Dependency tracking* via the expression graph
* *Incremental computation* via selective re-evaluation
* *Build policies* as different evaluation strategies

This extends naturally to:

* CI/CD pipeline visualization
* Infrastructure-as-spreadsheet (the Kubernetes joke... but maybe not a joke?)
* Data pipeline orchestration

== Cellular Automata Demo

Game of Life is already implemented in Data.Sheet and Data.Zipper:

[source,purescript]
----
life :: Sheet Boolean -> Boolean
life s = let alive = extract s
             count = length (filter identity (neighbors s))
         in if alive then count == 2 || count == 3 else count == 3

-- One generation
extend life sheet
----

Visual demo: animate the grid, show the comonadic context for each cell.

First, do what they already do, but better. Then show them what else is possible.
