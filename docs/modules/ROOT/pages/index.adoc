:description: Type-safe D3 selection and attribute library for PureScript

Type-safe D3 selection and attribute library for PureScript.

== What is PSD3 Selection?

PSD3 Selection brings D3.js-style data visualization to PureScript with full type safety. Instead of imperative D3 method chaining, you build a *tree AST* that describes your visualization, then interpret it to render.

[source,purescript]
----
myViz :: T.Tree Unit
myViz =
  T.named SVG "chart"
    [ attr "width" $ num 400.0
    , attr "height" $ num 300.0
    ]
    `T.withChild`
      T.elem Circle
        [ cx $ num 200.0
        , cy $ num 150.0
        , r $ num 50.0
        , fill $ text "steelblue"
        ]

== Why PSD3?

*Declarative*:: Build visualizations as data structures, not imperative sequences
*Type-safe*:: Catch errors at compile time, not runtime
*Testable*:: Multiple interpreters - render to DOM, to strings, to Mermaid diagrams
*Composable*:: Tree structures compose naturally
