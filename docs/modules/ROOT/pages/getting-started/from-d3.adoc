This guide is coming soon. It will cover:

* Key conceptual differences
* Mapping D3 patterns to PSD3
* Common gotchas
* When to use the escape hatches

== Quick Comparison

|===
| D3.js | PSD3

| Imperative method chaining
| Declarative tree building

| Mutable selections
| Immutable AST

| Runtime errors
| Compile-time type safety

| Single interpreter (DOM)
| Multiple interpreters (DOM, String, Mermaid)
|===

== The Big Idea

In D3, you *do* things to the DOM:

[source,javascript]
----
d3.select("body").append("svg").attr("width", 400)...
----

In PSD3, you *describe* what you want:

[source,purescript]
----
A.elem SVG [ width (num 400.0) ] `A.withChild` ...
----

Then an interpreter renders it.
